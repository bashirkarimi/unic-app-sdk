The capture rate also varies greatly depending on the industry: from 30-40% in retail to significantly lower values in regulated industries such as finance. In our practical test on Unic.com, we compared various SST solutions and gained concrete insights for practical application.",

In 2006, he proposed a fascinating thesis: successful companies always begin their business ideas and product visions with the \"why\". According to Sinek, the why is the central conviction and the most compelling reason for our actions. His model consists of three central questions: Why, How, and What.\n\nAt Unic, we have not only adopted the â€œWhy, How, Whatâ€ model, it is the basis of our Unic identity and is constantly changing. Because even though we have already internalized it, sustainability is now certified under â€œHowâ€ and firmly anchored in our DNA.",

It is therefore important to understand the why, to question it, in order to help shape and continuously develop the how and what. In other words, the model serves as a compass to ensure that our work always remains meaningful and purposeful. By clearly defining our why, we create a solid foundation on which to build our methods (the how) and our concrete actions and results (the what). This is how we ensure that we not only act effectively, but also authentically and sustainably.",

As the highest-grossing sales channel of Swiss Federal Railways, it is at the center of public interest.\n\nThis naturally creates considerable pressure: How does one handle the situation when it feels like half of the Swiss population is discussing and criticizing? How can one redesign the country\u0027s most popular application while all of Switzerland closely watches every development step? The successful redesign of the app demonstrates how these unique challenges can be mastered.",

In close collaboration with the illustrator, I was able to provide these creations and incorporate them into the design.

What are the challenges and advantages that come with this management framework and the transformation itself? Sandro DÃ¶nni, Principal Consultant at Unic and a key player in the introduction of Holacracy as a â€˜lead linkâ€™ in the change office back then, answers these and other questions in the interview below. Find out why the switch to Holacracy should be a one-way street and why traditional hierarchies just cannot compete with a distributed decision-making system.",

Having someone with experience and an outside view of things by your side also helps.

Given the current shortage of skilled labour, this is a crucial aspect that can be found in almost every manufacturing segment. Automated processes and the use of modern technologies as well as deeply intuitive software for machine controlling and operational optimisation mean that production lines can be operated with minimal human intervention. This not only reduces the error rate but also increases productivity and lowers costs. Manufacturers are increasingly focussing on intelligent machines that work independently and only require minimal supervision by qualified personnel.",

With a digital experience portal, customers receive an end-to-end solution for all their requirements that can be supported digitally. This not only creates a better customer experience but also increases business efficiency. Customers can easily manage their orders online, receive real-time updates and communicate directly with the service team. These integrated solutions are an important step towards a fully digitalised and customer-centric production environment.",

One of the key elements of Holacracy is the continual optimisation of processes and activities. That helped us get ever better at learning from mistakes and improving continually. This dynamic led to great enthusiasm in the team early on because we all felt like we were actively shaping our work environment. But it soon became evident that responsibilities were shifting with the introduction of Holacracy. Some focused more on the organisational aspects, while others dedicated themselves to the implementation of projects. Interestingly enough, Holacracy makes it possible for a person to be active in both fields, which requires flexible adaptation to the needs of the company and the employees.",

Often, employees contribute to the success of the company in different fields, which should be reflected in promotions and salaries.

There are many examples of hierarchical structures in which communication, transparency and agility are more than just empty phrases. In these cases, leaders fully trust teams and experts to do their work independently and effectively. They lead, clear the way and provide direction without delegating in the traditional sense.

Of course, positive ratings are a key indicator for applicants investigating a potential new employer. But personally, I find the developments we are seeing with our company alumni much more interesting. More and more, we find them returning to Unic. And the reasons appear to be similar: They identify with the company culture and the underlying values. Of course, the working conditions and good relationships with colleagues also matter. I wanted to know exactly what made them return to Unic and asked them about this.",

    "lead": "The term Kubernetes originates from Ancient Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. The open-source platform, also known as â€˜K8sâ€™, is used to manage so-called containers (see: Containerisation). Amongst other things, a K8s cluster can automate the deployment, scaling and management of applications with a modern design (cloud native) as needed, whether locally or in a public cloud infrastructure. In other words, Kubernetes assigns the instances/applications in the containers the required storage, network resources and CPU power and in parallel controls all application processes (workloads). Kubernetes also enables dynamic links between services/workloads, the automatic scaling of system components involved and the monitoring and automatic execution of updates.",

Frank Robinson is the first person to use the term â€˜MVPâ€™ and Steve Blank and Eric Ries popularised the MVP with their publication of The Lean Startup in 2011. According to the advocates of the MVP idea, the product development team should communicate closely with the target groups so that hypotheses on product development can be verified or falsified upfront. This reduces time and effort in development and increases the chances of the later product being received well. Even back in 2011, there were many references to digital products and software solutions.",

This also includes any indirect experiences with companies, for instance, when users hear about the experiences of others or when consumer organisations publish test results on products. The perception refers to services provided or to any experience that is part of a purchase process â€“ including the phase before purchase (research), the usage phase and the phase after completion of the purchase. The goal of CX is to create a consistently positive experience for customers â€“ along all touchpoints of the particular omnichannel or multichannel strategy.",

It is very easy for users today to find a similar or identical product or service offered by a different provider. According to the German Markenartikel Magazin, 50 per cent of users will switch to a competitor after a single bad experience. This is why CX has become such a crucial aspect, one that can make all the difference when competition is tough. It is closely linked to the user experience or rather is a part of it. Good CX is essential for a user-friendly digital presence (website, app, shop).",

An isolated datum is just a character or symbol. A collection of information and data and the combination of languages, graphics, images and gestures increase the information density of news, statements, claims etc. It is semantics that gives meaning to data and turns it into information. This describes the part of a message that is valuable to the recipient. Recipients can be persons or companies. Companies use the internet and information technology (IT) to connect data sets and link information (data processing) to customers (see e-commerce).",

For quite some time now, business systems have relied on a headless architecture, where the backend and frontend operate independently from each other. The advantage of this setup is that thanks to the systematic separation of both technologies, companies can use application programming interfaces (APIs) to dock different frontends to the same backend.

An omnichannel strategy provides various touchpoints without customers having to switch channels during the purchasing process: from billboards to QR codes, from websites to smartphone apps. Sales and communication channels merge seamlessly. Companies can not only see the interactions of a target group in a specific channel â€“ all information is linked systematically and is accessible. And if potential customers want to get a feel for the product before purchasing, this strategy enables them to complete the purchase in a local store.",
